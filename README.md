# Scrolling Text Animation

This project demonstrates a scrolling text animation with smooth transitions and optional interactive controls. It utilizes CSS properties for animation where supported, and falls back to GSAP for browsers that don't support it.

## Features

*   **Smooth Scrolling Animation:** Text smoothly animates as the user scrolls.
*   **Dynamic Color Change:** The text color dynamically changes during the scroll.
*   **Interactive Controls:** A Tweakpane control panel allows users to customize the animation, theme, hue, and other parameters.
*   **Responsive Design:** The text scales responsively to different screen sizes.
*   **Accessibility:** Includes ARIA attributes for screen readers.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Uses CSS properties where possible and GSAP for older browsers.
*   **Light and Dark Themes:** Supports light and dark color schemes.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
*   **CSS:** Styling and animations. Uses CSS Layers and Properties for modern browser support.
*   **JavaScript:** Interactivity and GSAP integration.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For advanced animations and scroll triggering in browsers that don't fully support CSS scroll-driven animations.
*   **Tweakpane:** For the interactive control panel.
*   **Normalize.css:** For consistent styling across browsers.
